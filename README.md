# Social Media Link Prediction
# Introduction
The problem of predicting the existence of a link between two entities in a network.
The problem can be coined as: the task of determining the likelihood that any two nodes that are not connected at time t = t0, will be connected at time t = ti (ti > t0).
The objective of link prediction is to identify pairs of nodes that will either form a link or not in the future.
Our work is to find the links between users that can happen in future.

# Documentation
One can find out more about the machine learning algorithms used for Prediction in the NS_Project_report.pdf and our web application can be found at tkinter Application.rar
# Dataset Description
We have used kaggle link prediction 2019 challenge dataset. 
It has :
Source Node Id , Destination Node Id and direction variable.
A directed edge from node u to node v indicates that u follows v. 
# Installation of Prediction Model
# Prerequisite
One needs Python 3.6 with standard libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy,sklearn and imblearn.
# Steps to run the code
1) Download the code using NS_Project_code.ipynb
2) Downlaod the dataset training.csv and testing.csv
3) You can run the code in your local machine having python 3.6 and libraries or you can use the Google Collab for running code without any difficulty.
